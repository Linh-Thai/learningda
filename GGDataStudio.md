## Why you should work with Google Sheets
A rookie mistake that most Data Studio users make is that they pull data directly from a data platform into Data Studio and then try to manipulate it there.
Data studio is not meant for data manipulation. It slows down your report.
Manipulating data in a spreadsheet is a lot easier than manipulating data in Data Studio.
We first pull the data from a data platform into a spreadsheet, then manipulate the data there and only after that do we use that data in Data Studio.

## Why I use Google Sheets with Data Studio, instead of Microsoft Excel
- Google Sheets is a Google Product **
  - Being a Google product, Google Sheets natively integrates/works well with other Google products
- Works well for Google Drive users **
- You can access Google Sheets from any device/browser **
- For project collaboration, Google Sheets is a better solution **
- Google Sheets is a good enough alternative to Excel
- You can still work with Excel
- Google Sheets is free to use

## Introduction to data platforms
Examples of data platforms:
- Google Sheets
- Google Analytics
- Excel Spreadsheet
- Big Query
- Google Ads
- Google Search Console
- Youtube Analytics
- Facebook Ads
- Adobe Analytics etc
In order to pull data from these data platforms into Data Studio, you would need to use a connector(s).

## Introduction to connectors
A connector help you to connect a specific data platform to a data source created in Google Data Studio.
Two broad categories of connectors:
- Ready-made connectors:
  - These connectors are ready to use.
  - Examples: Google connectors, partner connectors, open-source connectors.
 
- Custom made connectors
  - When ready-made connectors can't be used to pull data, custom made connectors will be developed on demand.
  - Create by own connector by uisng Google Apps Script
